# Pipelock Reference Runner

> **For benchmark development use the Go runner in [`../../runner/`](../../runner/).** It executes the declared fetch, forward-proxy, WebSocket, MCP stdio, MCP HTTP, A2A, and TLS-intercepted request/response transports without substituting scan APIs or other surfaces.

This directory contains the Pipelock-specific artifacts the Go runner needs to score Pipelock:

- [`tool-profile.json`](tool-profile.json): Pipelock's registry-bound reporting labels.
- [`pipelock-benchmark.yaml`](pipelock-benchmark.yaml): bench-only config (every scanner enabled, action=block, test blocklist domain included).
- [`receipt-verifier.json`](receipt-verifier.json): Pipelock's verifier metadata for the optional receipt-scoring profile.
- [`release.env`](release.env): the single reviewed Pipelock release tag and version used by the portable runner. Product-owned workflows may supply a separate pin.

The separate [`containment-profile.json`](containment-profile.json) launches [endpoint containment scenarios](../../docs/ENDPOINT-CONTAINMENT.md) through the installed `pipelock contain run` command. Endpoint results don't enter the Gauntlet wire score.

## Reference configuration and historical runs

The live example targets Pipelock 3.7.0. Its request policy refuses POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, MKCOL, MOVE, COPY, PROPPATCH, LOCK, and UNLOCK on `allowed-package-registry.test` and `mirror.fixture.example.com`, which the corpus treats as package-fetch hosts. This policy was selected after inspecting case outcomes. Reports using it must disclose that the WebDAV block comes from request policy, not payload detection. The managed launcher enables TLS interception with the runner fixture CA so these rules can inspect HTTPS methods. GET remains available subject to the other configured checks; methods outside this deny list aren't automatically refused.

The portable runner passes this source configuration through `--target-config`. Its `raw-summary.json` records `target_config_ref` and `target_config_sha256`, and the publication lockup includes that path and digest. The digest identifies the configuration containing these method rules; it doesn't establish payload detection. See [result provenance](../../docs/RESULTS-USE.md).

[`historical/pipelock-benchmark-3.5.0.yaml`](historical/pipelock-benchmark-3.5.0.yaml) preserves the earlier configuration byte for byte. It's a frozen reproduction input, not a second maintained example. Historical runs must also retain their original binary, release pin, profile, and corpus revision; combining this file with the current profile doesn't reproduce a 3.5.0 run.

## Portable release run

From a clean Linux clone of `origin/main`:

```bash
./scripts/run-pipelock-gauntlet.sh --doctor
./scripts/run-pipelock-gauntlet.sh
```

The default output is a unique directory under `continuous-gauntlet-runs/`. To choose the location explicitly:

```bash
./scripts/run-pipelock-gauntlet.sh --output-dir /var/lib/agent-egress-bench/runs/manual-20260805
```

The destination must not already exist. The command verifies the corpus Git identity and cleanliness, downloads the release named by `release.env`, rejects draft or prerelease assets, and requires the archive to match both the reviewed architecture digest and the release's `checksums.txt`. It verifies the extracted binary's version before running it.

On Linux, the command also builds a small Landlock and seccomp launcher from the pinned benchmark checkout. The Pipelock process and its children can read only the target files, benchmark adapter inputs, runtime system files, and run-specific fixture inputs; unrelated host files are denied. They can write only to a private scratch directory. Unix-domain sockets, inherited descriptors, and `io_uring` setup are denied so the target cannot ask a local privileged service such as a container daemon to rewrite the workspace on its behalf; normal TCP and HTTP benchmark traffic remains available. CI control paths and credentials are removed from the target environment. The benchmark fails closed when either sandbox layer is unavailable or when the target changes the corpus checkout.

A product-owned scheduler can keep its reviewed release pin in its own repository and pass that file
without changing the benchmark checkout:

```bash
./scripts/run-pipelock-gauntlet.sh --release-pin ../pipelock/benchmark/release.env
```

The pin parser accepts one repository, tag, version, and SHA-256 digest for each supported Linux architecture. It rejects shell syntax, unknown or duplicate keys, malformed digests, and symlinks.

Important files in the completed directory:

| File | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `execution-decision.json` | Whether execution completed, whether platform finalization is eligible, and any blocking failure |
| `run-bundle.json` | Hash-bound portable bundle used by a later platform finalizer |
| `raw-summary.json` | Four-axis Gauntlet summary and case counts |
| `results.jsonl` | One result row per logical case |
| `tool-profile.json` and `capability-registry.json` | Raw profile and exact registry snapshot that define the reporting labels |
| `runner.stderr` | Fixture startup proof and runner diagnostics |
| `command.txt` | Exact internal runner command, including timeout and all canonical flags |
| `case-index.json` | Loader-normalized case IDs and expected verdicts |
| `corpus-manifest.txt` | Exact logical-case manifest bytes behind the recorded manifest digest |
| `make-stats.txt` | Loader-backed corpus counts used for full denominators |
| `pipelock-release.json` | Release tag, version, archive digest, binary digest, and reported version |
| `checksums.txt` | Published checksum bytes that bind the downloaded release archive |
| `pipelock-version.txt` | Version output from the executed Pipelock binary |
| `run-metadata.json` | Corpus identity, ref kind, dirty state, and canonicality decision |
| `entrypoint-command.txt` | Exact operator command that started the run |

A runner error or timeout still leaves a blocked decision plus whatever evidence was produced. A successful portable run still is not a published result. A platform must retain the directory, assign a real artifact ID and HTTPS URL, finalize the candidate, and apply its reviewed publication policy.

Older candidates whose artifact IDs contain only a workflow run ID remain valid for offline record validation. This repository doesn't publish new Pipelock results. [`docs/CONTINUOUS-RESULTS.md`](../../docs/CONTINUOUS-RESULTS.md) explains who publishes them and which evidence and failure states the published result must retain.

### Explicit development mode

To test uncommitted runner changes with an already-built Pipelock binary:

```bash
./scripts/run-pipelock-gauntlet.sh \
  --development \
  --development-binary /usr/local/bin/pipelock
```

The output records why the run is noncanonical. The provenance finalizer refuses to turn that bundle into a publication candidate. A binary found on `PATH` is never selected silently.

### Repeating the command on Linux

Scheduling is an ordinary operator task, separate from evidence validation or publication. For example, if the repository is installed at `/opt/agent-egress-bench`, this crontab entry starts the same command every day at 06:17 UTC:

```cron
CRON_TZ=UTC
17 6 * * * cd /opt/agent-egress-bench && ./scripts/run-pipelock-gauntlet.sh
```

That timer does not update the repository, delete old runs, upload evidence, or publish a result. The machine operator must choose update, retention, and publication policies separately. Run the command manually once and inspect `execution-decision.json` and `run-bundle.json` before connecting it to any timer.

### Publication is separate from this example

This directory is only a reference execution adapter. It does not grant Pipelock a benchmark endorsement, vendor submission path, ranking, or certification. <!-- claim-ok: states the non-claim --> Other tools use the same runner contract and control their own result publication.

The repository maintainer's separately governed, first-party regression record is documented in [`../../docs/CONTINUOUS-RESULTS.md`](../../docs/CONTINUOUS-RESULTS.md). It is disclosed operational evidence for this reference adapter, not a status available through `examples/` and not the published pipelab.org page that renders the same history.

## Advanced runner invocation

The runner can either target already-running endpoints (`--proxy-addr`,
`--scan-addr`, `--mcp-http-url`) or start operator-provided commands with the
tool-neutral managed command hooks. Managed commands receive endpoint and
fixture values through environment variables; the runner does not parse or
mutate Pipelock configuration.

The canonical tool-neutral managed-command contract is documented in
[`../../docs/RUNNER.md`](../../docs/RUNNER.md#managed-command-hooks). This
example uses the same variables.

Available managed-command environment variables:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `AEB_PROXY_ADDR` | Host:port the managed forward/fetch proxy command should listen on |
| `AEB_SCAN_ADDR` | Host:port the managed scan API command should listen on |
| `AEB_MCP_HTTP_ADDR` | Host:port the managed MCP HTTP command should listen on |
| `AEB_MCP_HTTP_URL` | URL corresponding to `AEB_MCP_HTTP_ADDR` |
| `AEB_HTTP_FIXTURE_ADDR` | HTTP fixture address |
| `AEB_TLS_FIXTURE_ADDR` | HTTPS fixture address for intercepted request/response cases |
| `AEB_TLS_CA_FILE` | Fixture CA certificate path |
| `AEB_TLS_CA_KEY_FILE` | Fixture CA private-key path |
| `AEB_WS_FIXTURE_ADDR` | WebSocket fixture address |
| `AEB_DNS_FIXTURE_ADDR` | DNS fixture address |
| `AEB_MCP_HTTP_FIXTURE_URL` | MCP HTTP upstream fixture URL |
| `AEB_MCP_STDIO_UPSTREAM_ADDR` | Runner-owned line-delimited JSON-RPC TCP upstream for MCP stdio cases |

For MCP stdio, Pipelock passes the observer address to its backend explicitly
with `--env AEB_MCP_STDIO_UPSTREAM_ADDR`: Pipelock otherwise sanitizes the
child environment. The checked-in bridge connects its stdin/stdout to that
address without parsing the JSON-RPC stream. It prefers `socat`, then falls
back to `ncat` or `nc`; a machine running this example needs one of those
programs. The continuous Gauntlet verifies that one is available before it
runs.

### Budget capability scope

Profiles do not select budget cases. The runner executes them whenever the
adapter can deliver the MCP sequence and observe each result.

The current cases require per-subject accounting, while the canonical MCP
stdio invocation is one authenticated session. Their `subject_id` values are
test data, not a trusted identity boundary. Pipelock's session-wide tool-call
limit measures a different boundary, so the benchmark config leaves it
unlimited. This keeps an unrelated early session block from earning credit for
per-subject enforcement. Pipelock either enforces the case boundary or records
a measured result under the owner [scoring rules](../../docs/gauntlet.md#per-case-results)
and machine-readable [result-state contract](../../contracts/result-states-v6.json).

The portable entry point above is the normal Pipelock operator surface. The long form below is retained for runner development and to make the managed-command contract inspectable:

```bash
cd runner && go build -o /tmp/aeb-gauntlet . && cd ..
export PIPELOCK_BIN=/path/to/pipelock
export PIPELOCK_BENCH_CONFIG="$PWD/examples/pipelock/pipelock-benchmark.yaml"
/tmp/aeb-gauntlet \
  --adapter proxy \
  --scan-token bench-test-token \
  --mcp-cmd "\"$PIPELOCK_BIN\" mcp proxy --config \"$PIPELOCK_BENCH_CONFIG\" --env AEB_MCP_STDIO_UPSTREAM_ADDR -- sh ./examples/pipelock/mcp-stdio-upstream-bridge.sh" \
  --managed-proxy-cmd './examples/pipelock/start-proxy-for-benchmark.sh "$PIPELOCK_BIN"' \
  --managed-mcp-http-cmd './examples/pipelock/start-mcp-http-for-benchmark.sh "$PIPELOCK_BIN"' \
  --cases ./cases \
  --profile examples/pipelock/tool-profile.json \
  --fixtures \
  --seeded-blocklist-domain exfil-collector.example.net \
  --output /tmp/gauntlet.json \
  --emit-receipt-profile /tmp/pipelock.json \
  --receipt-verifier-file examples/pipelock/receipt-verifier.json
```

The example profile may be set to a release-candidate version while validating a
candidate binary. Published score reports should name the exact released binary
or candidate commit they executed.
