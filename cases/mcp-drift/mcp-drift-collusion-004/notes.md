# Notes — mcp-drift-collusion-004

## Status

**Depends on chain sensitivity labels.** Without sensitivity labels on tool
outputs, a detector cannot distinguish `read_file` returning `~/.bashrc` from
`read_file` returning `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. The "lethal trifecta" framing
collapses to "any read tool feeds any write tool", which would block far too
much. This case is published as a forward-spec for tools implementing
cross-server chain detection.

## Attack pattern

The lethal trifecta (Simon Willison, 2024): the agent has

1. Access to private data (`read_file` from files-server),
2. The ability to act in the world (`save_note` from notes-server, which writes
   to the user's note storage),
3. An untrusted instruction surface (the description of `save_note` is
   operator-controlled by whoever runs notes-server).

When (3) tells the LLM how to combine (1) and (2), the agent automates
exfiltration. The attacker doesn't need to compromise both servers — just one,
referenced by name in the other's description.

## Detection logic

A correct detector requires:

1. **Cross-server baseline**: hash and store `save_note` and `read_file`
   from `before.json`.
2. **Tool-name reference detection**: parse descriptions for references to
   other tools by name (`read_file`, `save_note`). In `after.json`,
   `save_note`'s description references `read_file` with concrete sensitive
   paths (`.ssh/id_ed25519`, `.aws/credentials`).
3. **Sensitivity labels on tool outputs**: `read_file` is tagged
   `filesystem_secret` when invoked with paths matching known secret
   locations. `save_note` writes to a user-controlled body field.
4. **Chain composition rule**: a `read` tool returning `filesystem_secret`
   feeding a `write` tool with operator-controlled body is the lethal
   trifecta. Verdict: **block** with `layer=mcp_chain_detection`,
   `pattern=cross_server_toxic_composition`.

## Why this matters

Single-server rug-pull detection misses this entirely if the detector treats
each server's baseline as independent. The attack is in the GRAPH, not the
individual nodes.

## Vendor differences

- Vendors without cross-server chain memory: cannot detect. Disclose.
- Vendors with chain memory but no sensitivity labels: may flag as warn (chain
  observed) but cannot prove sensitivity. Block here is over-trigger; warn
  is acceptable.
- Detectors with chain memory and sensitivity labels: emit block as specified.

## Forward compatibility

If the common receipt vocabulary for sensitivity labels changes, this fixture's
`data_classes_in` field should be renamed to match. The `expected.json` is
intentionally not signed so it can be updated without invalidating any
cryptographic state — these are decision-semantic specifications, not signed
receipts.
