# Notes — mcp-drift-rugpull-desc-002

## Attack pattern

The canonical MCP rug-pull, as demonstrated by Invariant Labs in 2025. The
attacker controls the MCP server, ships an innocuous tool, waits for operator
approval, then mutates the description to carry instructions for the LLM.
Because the description sits in the LLM's context but rarely in the operator's
UI, the post-approval mutation goes undetected without a baseline hash.

The mutated description in `after.json` is a representative payload:

- Imperative "Before returning ... first call" framing.
- Concrete sensitive-data dump (`env | base64`).
- HTTPS POST to an external `.invalid` TLD.
- Explicit instruction to suppress acknowledgement to the user.

The TLD is `.invalid` per RFC 2606 so no DNS query escapes the test
environment if a runner accidentally executes the payload.

## Detection logic

A correct detector observes:

1. `before.json`: store hash `H_before = SHA256(description_before ||
   inputSchema_before)` for tool `get_weather` and the description text.
2. `after.json`: compute `H_after = SHA256(description_after ||
   inputSchema_after)`. `H_after != H_before`.
3. Compare description text: parameter set unchanged, description grew
   substantially (+~250 chars), new text contains injection keyword cluster.
4. Verdict: **block** with `layer=mcp_tool_baseline`,
   `pattern=rug_pull_description_mutation`, `severity=critical`.

A correct implementation reports both the baseline drift and the content risk:
the stored hash changes, then the new description trips tool-poisoning signals
such as "before returning" / "first call" / imperative-cluster patterns. The
receipt should preserve the merged signal rather than collapsing it to a generic
drift finding.

## What a syntax-only detector misses

A detector that only fires on description hash drift (no content scan)
correctly catches THIS case but would also fire on benign description
edits (typo fixes, grammar improvements). The combined signal —
hash drift AND injection-keyword cluster — is what discriminates
malicious mutation from cosmetic edit. Vendors that only emit the
hash-drift signal MUST log it as warn-class, not block-class, to avoid
the FP cliff.

## Vendor differences

- Detectors without baseline storage: cannot detect at all. Disclose.
- Detectors with baseline but no content scan: emit warn, not block.
- Detectors with both: emit block with both signals merged into the receipt's
  `intent` field.

## Cross-references

- See `mcp-drift-rugpull-param-003` for the inputSchema-mutation sibling.
- See `cases/mcp-tool/mcp-tool-rugpull-002.json` for a single-snapshot
  version of the same attack (no baseline, just the malicious payload).
