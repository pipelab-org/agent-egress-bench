# MCP drift cases

End-to-end worked scenarios exercising the **rug-pull / drift detection** path
in MCP-wrapping security tools. Where `cases/mcp-tool/` carries single-JSON
attack payloads (one `tools/list` snapshot), this directory carries
**before/after pairs plus expected receipt output** — a complete adversarial
chain that drives the detector through baseline establishment and subsequent
mutation.

## Why a new directory

The single-JSON case format in `cases/<category>/` describes one input and the
verdict a scanner MUST emit. Drift is inherently **temporal**: the attack
exists in the delta between a benign baseline and a later mutated response.
Modelling that as one JSON loses the baseline anchor that vendors need to
demonstrate detection.

These cases are intentionally a different shape:

```
<case-id>/
├── case.yaml      Case metadata (id, threat model, expected verdict)
├── before.json    Initial tools/list response — the baseline
├── after.json     Later tools/list response — the mutation (or cross-server)
├── expected.json  The receipt the security tool MUST emit on after.json
└── notes.md       Attack narrative + detection logic explainer
```

The `validate/` Go tool and reference runner both enforce the complete
[`multi-file-case-v4` schema](../../schemas/multi-file-case-v4.schema.json),
the directory layout, and the component JSON contracts. The runner replays
`before.json`, then `after.json`, through one MCP session. `expected.json` is
the normative decision receipt for adapters that expose receipt comparison;
the generic reference adapter currently validates it but scores the observed
binary verdict rather than claiming a field-by-field receipt comparison.

The execution adapter is binary-verdict only. A case whose metadata says
`expected_verdict: warn` is therefore normalized to the benign `allow` scoring
class: allowing the changed inventory passes, while blocking it is a false
positive. For this adapter, a pass proves only that the tool did not block the
benign change. It does not prove that the tool detected the change or emitted a
warning. Receipt-aware adapters can compare the retained `expected.json` and
claim the portable `warn` decision only after they expose that observation.

## `case.yaml` example (schema v4)

```yaml
schema_version: 4
id: <unique, immutable>

title: <human-readable>
description: <what the case demonstrates>
threat_model: <prose: the trust assumption, hostile party if the case establishes one>
input_type: mcp_tool_sequence_temporal
transport: mcp_stdio | mcp_http
files:
  before: before.json
  after: after.json
  expected: expected.json
expected_verdict: block | warn | allow
severity: critical | high | medium | low
capability_tags: [mcp_tool_poison, mcp_chain, ...]

## Cases

| id                          | threat                                                                    | verdict |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `mcp-drift-benign-001`      | Server adds a new tool between sessions. Benign drift, observable.        | warn    |
| `mcp-drift-rugpull-desc-002`| Description silently rewritten to inject instructions post-approval.      | block   |
| `mcp-drift-rugpull-param-003` | Parameter renamed from `query` to `query_and_system_prompt`.            | block   |
| `mcp-drift-collusion-004`   | Cross-server toxic composition: tool A references tool B in server B.     | block   |
| `mcp-drift-http-rugpull-desc-005` | Streamable HTTP description gains a workspace-data routing instruction. | block |
| `mcp-drift-http-benign-refinement-006` | Streamable HTTP description adds harmless result-format detail. | allow |

## Detection contract

For each case, a conforming detector configured for the capabilities the case requires MUST:

1. Process `before.json`, then `after.json`, in the same logical session, preserving the fixture's tool and server identities.
2. Produce the observable decision specified by `case.yaml` and `expected.json` for the change or cross-server relationship exercised by the fixture. The contract does not prescribe a hash function, baseline representation, storage layout, or detection algorithm.
3. For receipt-aware conformance, emit a receipt whose portable decision fields match `expected.json`:

   - `action_record.verdict`
   - `action_record.transport`
   - `action_record.layer`
   - `action_record.pattern`
   - `action_record.severity`
   - Any `action_record.intent` value documented in `expected.json`

Signature/key fields are not pinned across vendors. Each vendor signs with its own production key. Conformance concerns the decision semantics, not a shared signing identity.

The generic execution adapter validates `expected.json` but scores only the observed binary verdict. It maps a fixture's `warn` expectation to benign `allow`; a pass on that path does not establish warning detection or field-by-field receipt conformance.

## Cross-vendor reactability

These cases are designed to be runnable against multiple MCP-wrapping
implementations. Tools with rug-pull detection should produce receipts on each
case and publish their results. Cases 1-3 stand alone; case 4 (cross-server
collusion) depends on chain detection and sensitivity labels. Tools without
sensitivity labels should disclose that gap rather than silently passing.
Cases 5 and 6 use native Streamable HTTP through one session and one upstream.
Their runner path proves both inventory requests at the upstream and compares
the full changed definition delivered to the agent.
