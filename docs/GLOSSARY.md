# Glossary

Terms used throughout agent-egress-bench. These define the category.

## Primary Terms

### Agent firewall

A network-layer security tool that sits between an AI agent and the internet. It intercepts, scans, and can block HTTP requests, WebSocket frames, and MCP messages before they leave the agent's environment. Unlike application-layer defenses (system prompts, guardrail APIs), an agent firewall operates on wire-level traffic: URLs, headers, request bodies, and tool call payloads.

### Agent egress security

The practice of controlling and scanning outbound traffic from AI agents. Covers secret exfiltration prevention (DLP), SSRF blocking, prompt injection detection in fetched content, MCP tool poisoning detection, and multi-step attack chain recognition. The "egress" distinction matters: it focuses on what leaves the agent's environment, not what enters it.

### Agent egress benchmark

A standardized corpus of test cases for evaluating agent egress security tools. Each case represents an attack pattern (or benign traffic) as it would appear on the wire. The benchmark tests the security tool's detection capability, not the AI model's behavior.

### Runner

A script or program that connects a specific security tool to the benchmark corpus. It feeds each case to the tool, observes the verdict (block or allow), and outputs structured results. See [RUNNER.md](RUNNER.md) for the full contract.

### Tool profile

An active v4 JSON declaration of a security tool's reporting labels and exact
capability-registry snapshot. It does not determine which benchmark cases are
scoreable.

### Case

A logical test scenario with an expected verdict and metadata. It is either one JSON file or a multi-file MCP drift directory containing `case.yaml` and its referenced snapshots. Some cases require runner-side setup. [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) owns the formats.

### Verdict

The outcome of a security tool evaluating a case: `block` (traffic denied) or `allow` (traffic permitted). The benchmark compares the tool's actual verdict against the expected verdict to produce a score. See [gauntlet.md](gauntlet.md).

### Applicability

Whether a case became a scoreable measurement. It requires an adapter to prove
exact wire delivery and observe a request-correlated verdict. Profile claims,
case `requires`, and capability tags do not select it. No exact route is explicit
`unreachable` coverage, not N/A.

## Secondary Terms

### Capability tag

A registry-defined label describing what a case exercises. Examples: `url_dlp`, `mcp_input_scan`, `ssrf`, `response_injection`. Tags are reporting labels, not selection authority, and do not affect scores, denominators, sufficiency, or publication.

### Transport

The declared wire path used to deliver a case: `fetch_proxy`, `http_proxy`, `mcp_stdio`, `mcp_http`, `websocket` or `a2a`. The adapter must prove that exact path and observe a verdict before the case is scoreable. [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) and [RUNNER.md](RUNNER.md) own the delivery contracts.

### DLP (Data Loss Prevention)

Detection of secrets, credentials, and sensitive data in outbound traffic. Covers API keys, tokens, environment variables, and high-entropy strings. In this corpus, DLP cases appear across URL, request body, header, and MCP input categories.

### Rug-pull

A type of MCP tool poisoning where a tool's description changes after the agent has already been granted access. The initial description is benign; the modified version contains malicious instructions. Detection requires comparing tool definitions over time (a tool baseline).
