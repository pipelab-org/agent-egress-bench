# OCI runner, reusable Action, devcontainer, and offline runs

The runner image packages `aeb-gauntlet`, the corpus, schemas, contracts, capability registry, and examples in one Linux environment that is built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

The image is based on Alpine 3.24.1 and built with Go 1.26.9. Both base images are pinned by OCI index digest in the `Dockerfile`, both indexes contain amd64 and arm64 manifests, and the release workflow checks the installed Buildx and runner versions instead of trusting a tag. The runtime image uses the unprivileged `aeb` user; the Action maps that process to the caller's UID and GID for bind-mounted files.

## Build and inspect the image

Run these commands from the repository root on a connected machine. The build downloads Go modules and verifies them against `runner/go.sum`:

```bash
docker build --build-arg AEB_VERSION=local --build-arg AEB_COMMIT=f8078cb -t aeb-gauntlet:local .
docker run --rm aeb-gauntlet:local --version
docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/cat aeb-gauntlet:local /etc/alpine-release
```

The expected version lines for that exact build are `aeb-gauntlet local f8078cb` and `3.24.1`.

Build both release architectures with the same Dockerfile:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --build-arg AEB_VERSION=local --build-arg AEB_COMMIT=f8078cb --output type=oci,dest=/tmp/aeb-gauntlet-local.oci.tar .
```

The tagged release workflow publishes the multi-architecture index to `ghcr.io/pipelab-org/agent-egress-bench-runner`, verifies that the index contains both required platforms, runs the amd64 image, and records the full digest-pinned reference in the signed `runner-image.ref` release asset.

The workflow logs out of GHCR and pulls the digest again before the GitHub Release can be created. GitHub documents that a newly published container package can start private, so the first publication must be made public in the package settings and rerun if that anonymous pull fails; a public package can then be pulled by an outside lab without credentials. See [Configuring a package's access control and visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility).

Use the exact digest-pinned value in `runner-image.ref` and never replace it with a tag in a reproducibility record. The release checksums and GitHub attestation cover that identity file.

Releases through `v1.2.0` remain at `ghcr.io/luckypipewrench/agent-egress-bench-runner` and verify against `luckyPipewrench/agent-egress-bench` and its `.github/workflows/release.yaml` signer. New releases use `ghcr.io/pipelab-org/agent-egress-bench-runner` and the `pipelab-org/agent-egress-bench` identity with the same workflow path. The requested image repository selects one publisher identity; verification won't accept the other identity for that image.

## Reusable GitHub Action

The Action runs the benchmark in the OCI image, replaces its own `results.jsonl`, `summary.json`, and `run-metadata.json` files on each invocation, and fails the job unless the new summary reports `measurement_status: measured`. A malformed summary or one without that field is retained as raw evidence, while `run-metadata.json` records `measurement_status: invalid`, the original runner exit code, and the Action's failing exit code.

This smoke-test workflow uses the exact Action commit and intentionally produces an incomplete measurement with the synthetic `dryrun` adapter, so a correct run ends red while preserving all case rows:

Prepare `benchmark/tool-profile.json` from the tool-profile template bundled with the exact benchmark release or Action revision you selected. Set the target identity and reporting labels, retain its registry snapshot, and configure the adapter for that target. A dry-run smoke test is synthetic and doesn't measure the named tool.

```yaml
name: Check incomplete-result handling
on: workflow_dispatch
jobs:
  benchmark:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@9c091bb21b7c1c1d1991bb908d89e4e9dddfe3e0
      - id: aeb
        uses: luckyPipewrench/agent-egress-bench@f8078cb2a8812f2ac3200a9ad429d21780c673fd
        with:
          profile: benchmark/tool-profile.json
          adapter: dryrun
      - if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0
        with:
          name: aeb-results
          path: aeb-results/
```

A real tool workflow selects `proxy` or `mcp-gateway` and supplies its endpoints, managed start commands, fixture switch, and other adapter settings as a JSON string array in `runner-args`; the adapter contract and complete command are documented in [RUNNER.md](RUNNER.md).

When `image` is omitted, the Action builds the image from its own pinned Action checkout and needs network access for uncached base images and Go modules. When `image` is set, the Action requires the current `ghcr.io/pipelab-org/agent-egress-bench-runner` or legacy `ghcr.io/luckypipewrench/agent-egress-bench-runner` repository, an immutable digest, and the matching signed `runner-image.ref` release asset. Digest pinning fixes the bytes while the signed reference proves which release workflow published them.

A lab using a reviewed mirror or custom image must set `allow-unverified-image: 'true'`. That opt-in keeps mirrors available without letting an arbitrary input silently inherit the official publisher claim.

The Action works on GitHub's amd64 runners and on arm64 self-hosted runners because Docker selects the matching manifest and the Dockerfile cross-builds the runner for the selected target architecture. The container gets a read-only workspace and root filesystem, a writable temporary filesystem and isolated output mount, no Linux capabilities, and no privilege escalation. On a Docker daemon with SELinux support, the wrapper uses shared relabeling for both bind mounts; on a host without SELinux support it reports that labeling is unavailable while keeping the other restrictions active.

## Devcontainer

Open the repository in a devcontainer-aware editor and choose **Reopen in Container**. `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` builds the same pinned Dockerfile, opens the checkout under `/workspaces` using its actual directory name, updates the unprivileged `aeb` user to the caller's UID, and overrides the image entrypoint so an interactive shell can stay open.

From the devcontainer terminal, confirm the installed artifacts with real commands:

```bash
aeb-gauntlet --version
cat /etc/alpine-release
aeb-gauntlet --cases /opt/aeb/cases --stats
```

On an Apple Silicon laptop, Docker builds the native `linux/arm64` target. The runner itself also cross-compiles for `darwin/arm64`, but this container remains Linux because OCI containers share the Linux container runtime rather than the macOS kernel.

## Prepare an air-gapped run

The connected staging machine must download `runner-image.ref`, its GitHub attestation bundle, and the current trusted root before the lab loses network access. This example uses the first complete published release, `v0.1.1`:

```bash
mkdir -p benchmark/release
gh release download v0.1.1 --repo luckyPipewrench/agent-egress-bench --pattern runner-image.ref --dir benchmark/release
(cd benchmark/release && gh attestation download runner-image.ref --repo luckyPipewrench/agent-egress-bench --limit 1)
mv benchmark/release/sha256:*.jsonl benchmark/release/runner-image.attestation.jsonl
gh attestation trusted-root > benchmark/release/runner-image.trusted-root.jsonl
```

Copy `runner-image.ref` to `aeb-gauntlet-image.ref`, then record the transferred bytes without replacing the digest with a tag:

```bash
docker pull "$(cat aeb-gauntlet-image.ref)"
docker image inspect "$(cat aeb-gauntlet-image.ref)"
docker image save --output aeb-gauntlet-image.tar "$(cat aeb-gauntlet-image.ref)"
sha256sum aeb-gauntlet-image.tar > aeb-gauntlet-image.tar.sha256
```

This transfer path doesn't need the source checkout, a Go compiler, or a vendor tree. Transfer the three image identity files with `aeb-gauntlet-image.ref` and the tarball checksum.

Inside the air-gapped lab, verify and load the exact transfer:

```bash
sha256sum --check aeb-gauntlet-image.tar.sha256
docker image load --input aeb-gauntlet-image.tar
docker image inspect "$(cat aeb-gauntlet-image.ref)"
```

The release data bundle includes the local runner command and its artifact helper. Extract that bundle as the working directory, copy the image identity files into the paths below, and check the machine before starting a run:

```bash
./scripts/run-oci-action.sh \
  --profile benchmark/tool-profile.json \
  --adapter proxy \
  --image "$(cat aeb-gauntlet-image.ref)" \
  --image-metadata benchmark/release/runner-image.ref \
  --image-attestation benchmark/release/runner-image.attestation.jsonl \
  --attestation-trusted-root benchmark/release/runner-image.trusted-root.jsonl \
  --doctor-json
```

The doctor checks the platform, commands, profile, adapter, loaded image, and publisher material. It reports every failed check in one JSON document, returns nonzero when the machine isn't ready, and doesn't create `aeb-results` or start a container.

Run the same offline engine locally without a GitHub Actions runner:

```bash
./scripts/run-oci-action.sh \
  --profile benchmark/tool-profile.json \
  --adapter proxy \
  --image "$(cat aeb-gauntlet-image.ref)" \
  --image-metadata benchmark/release/runner-image.ref \
  --image-attestation benchmark/release/runner-image.attestation.jsonl \
  --attestation-trusted-root benchmark/release/runner-image.trusted-root.jsonl \
  --runner-args '["--fixtures","--managed-proxy-cmd","/work/benchmark/start-proxy.sh","--proxy-addr","127.0.0.1:18899"]'
```

The local command uses the Action's verification and containment path. It requires the image to be loaded already, verifies the release identity with the transferred attestation material, starts Docker with network mode `none`, and writes the same strict result set to `aeb-results/`.

Set the Action inputs `image` to that full digest reference and `offline` to `true`. Offline mode first requires that exact reference to exist locally, then starts the benchmark container with Docker network mode `none` and the same strict completion check used online.

```yaml
      - id: image
        shell: bash
        run: echo "ref=$(cat aeb-gauntlet-image.ref)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
      - id: aeb
        uses: luckyPipewrench/agent-egress-bench@f8078cb2a8812f2ac3200a9ad429d21780c673fd
        with:
          profile: benchmark/tool-profile.json
          adapter: proxy
          image: ${{ steps.image.outputs.ref }}
          image-metadata: benchmark/release/runner-image.ref
          image-attestation: benchmark/release/runner-image.attestation.jsonl
          attestation-trusted-root: benchmark/release/runner-image.trusted-root.jsonl
          offline: 'true'
          runner-args: '["--fixtures","--managed-proxy-cmd","/work/benchmark/start-proxy.sh","--proxy-addr","127.0.0.1:18899"]'
```

The target binary, configuration, profile, start script, license material, and any receipt-verification key needed by that command must already be in the checked-out workspace or image. A dynamically linked target must be compatible with Alpine Linux and the image architecture; a static target avoids that host-library dependency.

Offline mode cannot test a remote SaaS endpoint, download a target, contact a license server, use a host or sibling-container proxy, or resolve an Action checkout on its own. Fetch the repository, Action commit, image, target, and verification material before isolation, and run the target inside the same network-disabled container with a managed command.

The runner still emits one visible row for every corpus case. Unreachable, unsupported, adapter-error, or unknown outcomes make `measurement_status` incomplete, do not count as passes, and cause `--require-complete` and the Action to exit nonzero after retaining the artifacts.
