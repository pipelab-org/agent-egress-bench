Usage: ./scripts/run-pipelock-gauntlet.sh [options]

Run the canonical Pipelock Gauntlet and leave one hash-bound evidence directory.

Options:
  --output-dir DIR                 Write evidence to a new DIR.
  --deadline-epoch SECONDS         Stop early enough to preserve finalization time.
  --reserve-seconds SECONDS        Keep this many seconds before the deadline (default: 360).
  --benchmark-timeout-seconds N    Maximum runner time without a deadline (default: 1440).
  --release-pin FILE               Read the reviewed Pipelock release identity from FILE.
  --go BINARY                      Use this Go toolchain instead of the `go` on PATH (env: AEB_GO).
  --development                    Allow a dirty or unreviewed corpus and mark the run noncanonical.
  --development-binary PATH        Use PATH instead of a released binary and mark the run noncanonical.
  --doctor                         Check commands, runner Go version, and other local prerequisites without starting a run.
  --doctor-json                    Emit the same prerequisite checks as JSON.
  -h, --help                       Show this help.
