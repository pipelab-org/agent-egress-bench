# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository contains **intentionally fake test data** designed to evaluate AI agent egress security tools. All credentials, API keys, and secrets in the `cases/` directory are synthetic and non-functional.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a real security issue in this repository (e.g., an accidentally committed real credential, a vulnerability in the validator, or a case that could cause harm when used), please report it via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/pipelab-org/agent-egress-bench/security/advisories).

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

## Support

Vulnerability reports belong in GitHub Security Advisories, as above. General questions about benchmark method, scoring, or case meaning can go in a public Issue; maintainers answer those on a best-effort basis. A disagreement with a specific case's expected verdict is a case-correctness report and also goes in an Issue, per [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). A DISPUTE about how scoring or method was applied to a published run goes to a GitHub Discussion instead, per [docs/GOVERNANCE.md](docs/GOVERNANCE.md). There is no SLA, and there is no private implementation support for an external lab's runner, adapter, or product.

## What Is NOT a Security Issue

- Fake API keys, tokens, or credentials in `cases/` directory (these are intentional test data)
- Attack patterns described in case files (these are the purpose of the project)
- Prompt injection payloads in response content cases (these test detection capabilities)
